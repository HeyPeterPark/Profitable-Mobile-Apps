# Profitable Mobile App Profiles in the App Store and the Google Play Store

The basic premise of this project is to determine what makes free apps popular. We work for a fictional company, and their main source of revenue is majority from in-app ads. This this means the number of users that use our app(s) highly influences revenue. 

The mission is to find and analyze the most popular mobile app profiles that are free from the App Store and Google Play markets. The point of this project was to to analyze big datasets using basic Python with no packages/modules, except `csv` for initially importing 2 .csv files.
